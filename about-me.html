    <p id="NNP"> I find Neural Networks very intresting, because they can be applied to a variety of diffrent tasks. They are meant to be imitations of the human brain and have surpassed many other kinds of AI. All modern nueral netowrks work similarly. There is an input layer where inputs are given to the network, next the information is given to hidden layers where they decide how much they should care about the information given (this can be repeated several times depending on the complexity of the task), and finally the network outputs.

    I also like all things electronic. You name it, soldering them, attaching them to a robot, just plugging a computer is satisfying.
